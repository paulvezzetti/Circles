## Circles Garmin Watch Face

A custom watch face for Garmin's new AMOLED displays on the Forerunner 265 and Forerunner 965. I developed this watch face because I didn't like any of the available watch faces and because I can. This watch face is not currently configurable. It displays the time, date, heart rate, sunrise/sunset and current weather as text.

Your steps, stairs climbed, body battery and stress are displayed as concentric circles in the background. The blue circle in the upper right is your body battery measurement. This is largest in the morning after a night sleep and gets smaller throughout the day with activity. Stress tends to reduce body battery so it is represented as a yellow circle inside the blue body battery circle. On the left side is your steps represented by a green circle. This circle grows as your steps grow throughout the day. When you reach your step goal the diameter of the green circle will stretch from the center of the watch face to the edge. If you exceed your goal, the circle will continue to expand with more and more of it displaying offscreen. The orange circle in the lower half of the screen represents your stairs climbed. This works like the steps with the size relative to your goal.
