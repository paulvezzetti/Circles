## Circles Garmin Watch Face

A custom watch face for Garmin's new AMOLED displays on the Forerunner 265 and Forerunner 965. I developed this watch face because I didn't like any of the available watch faces and because I can. This watch face is not currently configurable. It displays the time, date, heart rate, sunrise/sunset and current weather as text.

Your steps, stairs climbed, body battery and stress are displayed as concentric circles in the background.
